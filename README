
DualDatePickerDialog

can select a date from one of two calendars.

In many countries optional calendar 
is used together with main calendar. For example in Korea, Gregorian calendar 
is used mainly but Korean lunisolar calendar is also used for various traditional
events. 

DualDatePickerDialog lets the caller to select a date from one of two calendars
by showing them altogether. 

User can switch two calendars using UI elements (which will be changed to improve
usability).

DualDatePickerDialog uses CalendarDatePicker which is not Android standard DatePicker widget.



CalendarDatePicker

similar to android's DatePicker widget, but works with Calendar instance.

Android's DatePicker widget works well with GregorianCalendar, but doens't support
non-Gregorian calendar. CalendarDatePicker works with any Calendar-subclassing instances.

This package provides a KoreanLunisolarCalendar class to support Korean lunisolar calendar.
